# My Hardhat Token

This is a simple smart contract that represents a token that can be transferred between accounts.

## Features

* A name and symbol to identify the token.
* A total supply of tokens.
* A mapping of account balances.
* An event to notify off-chain applications of token transfers.
* Functions to mint, burn, and transfer tokens.

## Usage

To use the contract, you will need to deploy it to a blockchain network. Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the following functions:

* `mint()`: This function mints new tokens and assigns them to an account.
* `burn()`: This function burns tokens, reducing the total supply and the balance of the account that is burning the tokens.
* `transfer()`: This function transfers tokens from one account to another.
* `balanceOf()`: This function returns the balance of an account.

## Example

The following code shows how to mint, burn, and transfer tokens using the contract:


const token = await ethers.contract("0x...");

// Mint 100 tokens to the account 0x1234567890abcdef.
await token.mint(0x1234567890abcdef, 100);

// Burn 50 tokens from the account 0x1234567890abcdef.
await token.burn(0x1234567890abcdef, 50);

// Transfer 25 tokens from the account 0x1234567890abcdef to the account 0xdeadbeefcafebabe.
await token.transfer(0xdeadbeefcafebabe, 25);
